# Database Schema Ownership

Per stakeholder direction, all database schema definitions belong to Apache, Capaciti, and ALX.

This repository will:

- Treat schema artifacts as owned by the above entities.
- Avoid embedding third-party proprietary schema content without explicit written approval.
- Clearly attribute authorship/ownership in schema files and migration scripts when added.

If you provide authoritative schema sources or approvals, we will integrate them and preserve attribution accordingly.
